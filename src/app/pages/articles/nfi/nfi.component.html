        <b>Noise Frequency - Impulse</b> is about myself in this act of courage to try to make what destiny gave me without the possibility to deny. Is about my fears, my madness in a conscience process of what was the real risk. Is about how I deal with this dream, how I deal with the message’s and how I deal all with this signals that are strange and new to me. This work and my life, is the real impulse, and I offer some noisy frequencies. This work is a way to gain money too, as I cannot stop doing it, before know the feedback I am asking to. I made a <a href="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/bass-drop-blend">blend</a> of <a href="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/between-us-image-and-sound">image and sound</a>, that take me into the <a href="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/not-bad-wrong">wrong</a> path, so I could learn how to escape from it or manipulate it, becoming part of it in a real time package, that is connected into reality by sensitive <a href="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/dimensional-party-bit-parity">perceptions</a>, in a constante <a href="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/failure-people-dont-care">failure</a>, in this <a href="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/minimal-life-another-planet">world</a> that don’t need much to have peace and happiness, to understand how much I need my intelligence but even more my <a href="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/body-answer-common-sense-is-not-intelligence">common sense</a>, working my <a href="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/just-a-technical-skill-set">technical skills</a> of real time perceptions, talk about the known <a href="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/fuck-politic-sex-is-fun-vs-fuck-sex-politic-is-fun">duality</a> of human life in this precise moment to <a href="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/extreme-flow-go-deep-into-spiritual-life">flow</a> me into the conscience of my own <a href="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/i-know-myself-i-am-a-free-men">freedom</a>, as result of exterior <a href="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/time-code-stealth-mode">inputs</a> that I should learn to make what was in cause.
