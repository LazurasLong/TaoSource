        We Will Always Upgrade our Internal <span style="color:lightblue">Knowledge</span>, many times called as Intellectual,
<span style="color:aquamarine">Intelligence</span> or even <span style="color:blanchedalmond">Spirituality</span>,
because in fact, the <span style="color:azure">Spiritual</span>
<span style="color:lightblue">Knowledge</span> is a mix between what we know and what we identify as important to us,
as a tool to make us better, or even as information that we may like to care, which may be useful. While this share give to all readers an opportunity to upgrade their own <span style="color:lightblue">Knowledge</span> as well, because this is not only text, this is not only <b>Music</b>, this is a <i><span style="color:yellowgreen">World Wide Target Shamanic Quest</span></i>, that is made of <b>Dreams</b>, made of <b>illusions</b>, like all other things you may Create or use to Your personal life or even as a Real Tool, that give You functionality to do specific things You wish to Care in reality! But what is reality, if not an expression of Will?
