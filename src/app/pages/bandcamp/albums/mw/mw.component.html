          This album is in fact a description of reality in the way of describing the human abstract wills and desires, to upgrade knowledge and to use technology for their own progress. In the shadows, there was a <a hred="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/storming-plan-enigmatic-war">Storming Plan</a> to reclaim War, because this reality was draining human’s time and true pleasure, the simplicity of living Free.
          Humanity was more and more concentrated in cities, and human laws ask <a routerLink="/bc/mw/t/mw3" routerLinkActive="active">control</a> to all of them.
          They live for business and pleasures mostly at night, where all the interactions were close to any <a href="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/forest-jungle-at-night">jungle</a>. in any forest.
          Listening groovy music in a strange way, vibrations could be <a href="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/strange-groove-noise">noisy</a> and they were putting their life’s, between <a href="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/panic-luck">Panic and Luck</a> In form of Art and Expression, they represent <a href="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/pain-art-illusion-and-expression">pain</a> in many ways and in different forms using different sources, to <a href="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/noise-breaker-lead-the-way">break</a> their personal noise, so they could <a href="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/time-to-live-cache-cleaner">clean</a> their soul like a <a href="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/thunder-with-within-and-without">thunder</a>. and finally understand that <a href="https://odicforcesounds.bandcamp.com/track/have-fun-nothing-wrong-with-you-too">nothing</a> was wrong with them, because it was only a way to express them self’s.
